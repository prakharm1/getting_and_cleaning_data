# getting_and_cleaning_data

This repository contains the final course project submission for Coursera course getting and cleaning data. 

* 1. I have added the R code run_analysis.R in this repo which as requested in the assignment performs the analysis and returns the independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

* 2. codebook.md contains the variable description

* 3. final tidy data is stored in tidy.txt and exists on the repo
